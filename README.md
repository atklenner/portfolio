# Sketches
Interactive sketches viewable in a browser made with p5.js inspired by [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, TypeScript, p5.js, Vite, Astro

There are two parts to this project. The new-sketch directory was made using the vanilla JS template provided by Vite. It is a playground I use for making a new sketch. Once I am finished with the new sketch it moves to the astro directory and becomes a new page.

## Optimizations

When I add more sketches in the future I would like to add tags to the individual sketches to let people browse similar sketches more easily. Also I haven't made the site mobile friendly yet because I'm not sure how I want it to look just yet.

## Lessons Learned:

I used this project to try out using Astro to build a content rich website, it's a pretty slick tool that I would use again. I also learned how to use bash scripts to make adding pages to Astro easy which will reduce the overhead in the future when I want to make more sketches.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
