# Interactive p5 Sketches

Interactive sketches in the browser made with p5.js inspired by [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com). Each sketch is an exploration in some area of math, computer science, and physics.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, TypeScript, p5.js, Vite, Astro, Pico.CSS

There are two parts to this project. The new-sketch directory was made using the vanilla JS template provided by Vite. It is a playground I use for making a new sketch using p5. Once I am finished with the new sketch it moves to the astro directory and becomes a new page. The final website is built using astro and hosted using GitHub pages. The CSS styling comes from Pico.CSS

Sketches are inspired by topics like [Cellular Automata](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cellular_automaton), [Lorenz Systems](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lorenz_system), or [Perlin Noise](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Perlin_noise).

## Optimizations

When I add more sketches in the future I would like to add tags to the individual sketches to let people browse similar sketches more easily. Also I haven't made the site mobile friendly yet because I'm not sure how I want it to look.

## Lessons Learned:

I used this project to try out using Astro to build a content rich website, it's a pretty slick tool that I would use again. I also learned how to use bash scripts to make adding pages to Astro easy which will reduce the overhead in the future when I want to make more sketches.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
